        Added support for SQL standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. If
        equivalent SQL for the standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA view is

        Added support for get index information views. This SQL will be
        used in preference to the getIndexInfo JDBC method to allow for
        databases and drivers that do not support getIndexInfo due to
        permissioning issues.
